ACT I
</p>
<p class="intro">
<i>
A large old-fashioned room in Matthew Beeler's farm-house, near a small town in the Middle West. The room is used for dining and for general living purposes. It suggests, in architecture and furnishings, a past of considerable prosperity, which has now given place to more humble living. The house is, in fact, the ancestral home of Mr. Beeler's wife, Mary, born Beardsley, a family of the local farming aristocracy, now decayed. At the rear is a large double window, set in a broad alcove. To the right of the window is the entrance door, which opens upon the side yard, showing bushes, trees, and farm buildings.
</i>
</p>
<p class="intro">
<i>
In the right wall of the room a door and covered stairway lead to the upper story. Farther forward is a wall cupboard, and a door leading into the kitchen. Opposite this cupboard, in the left-hand wall of the room, is a mantelpiece and grate; farther back a double door, leading to a hall. Off the hall open two bedrooms (not seen), one belonging to Mr. and Mrs. Beeler, the other to Rhoda Williams, a niece of Mrs. Beeler, child of her dead sister.
</i>
</p>
<p class="intro">
<i>
The room contains, among other articles of furniture, a dining table (with detachable leaves to reduce its bulk when not in use for eating purposes), an invalid's wheel-chair, a low sofa of generous size, and a book-shelf, upon which are arranged the scientific books which Mr. Beeler takes a somewhat untutored but genuine delight in. Tacked upon the wall near by are portraits of scientific men, Darwin and Spencer conspicuous among them, cut from periodicals.
</i>
<i>
Other pictures, including family daguerreotypes and photographs, are variously distributed about the walls. Over the mantel shelf hangs a large map of the United States and Mexico, faded and fly-specked.
</i>
</p>
<p class="intro">
<i>
As the curtain rises, the room is dark, except for a dull fire in the grate. The ticking of the clock is heard; it strikes six. Martha Beeler, a woman of forty-five, enters from the kitchen, carrying a lighted lamp. She wears a shawl over her shoulders, a print dress, and a kitchen apron. She places the lamp on the table, which is set for breakfast, and puts coal on the grate, which soon flames more brightly.
</i>
</p>
<p class="intro">
<i>
She goes into the hall and is heard knocking and calling.
</i>
</p>
<br>
<p class="person">
Martha.
</p>
<p>
Rhody! Rhody!
</p>
<p class="direction">
<i>
Matthew Beeler, a man of fifty, enters. He is not quite dressed, but finishes as he comes in. Martha follows him.
</i>
</p>
<p>
Where's that niece of yours got to now?
</p>
<p class="person">
Beeler.
</p>
<p>
She's helping Mary dress.
</p>
<p class="person">
Martha.
</p>
<p>
What in time's Mary gettin' up for? She's only in the way till the work's done.
</p>
<p class="person">
Beeler.
</p>
<p>
She's restless.
</p>
<p class="person">
Martha.
</p>
<p class="direction">
<i>
Significantly.
</i>
</p>
<p>
I shouldn't wonder.
<i>
Pause.
</i>
I hope you know
<i>
why
</i>
Mary didn't sleep.
</p>
<p class="person">
Beeler.
</p>
<p class="direction">
<i>
Evasively.
</i>
</p>
<p>
She's always been a light sleeper, since she got her stroke.
</p>
<p class="person">
Martha.
</p>
<p>
Look here, Mat Beeler! I'm your born sister. Don't try to fool me! You know why your wife didn't sleep last night.
</p>
<p class="person">
Beeler.
</p>
<p>
Maybe I do, Sis.
</p>
<p class="direction">
<i>
Points to the ceiling.
</i>
</p>
<p>
Is he up yet?
</p>
<p class="person">
Martha.
</p>
<p>
Up! I don't believe he's been abed.
</p>
<p class="direction">
<i>
They listen, as to the tread of some one on the floor above.
</i>
</p>
<p>
Back and forth, like a tiger in a cage!
</p>
<p class="person">
Beeler.
</p>
<p class="direction">
<i>
Shrugs.
</i>
</p>
<p>
Queer customer.
</p>
<p class="person">
Martha.
</p>
<p>
Yes.
</p>
<p class="direction">
<i>
Imitates him.
</i>
</p>
<p>
&#34;Queer customer,&#34; that's you. But come to doin' anything about it!
</p>
<p class="person">
Beeler.
</p>
<p>
Give me time, Sis, give me time!
</p>
<p class="person">
Martha.
</p>
<p>
How much time do you want? He's been in this house since Wednesday night, and this is Saturday morning.
</p>
<p class="person">
Beeler.
</p>
<p>
Well, he's payin' his board, ain't he?
</p>
<p class="direction">
<i>
At window, rolls up curtain.
</i>
</p>
<p>
Goin' to have just such another day as yesterday. Never seen such a fog.
</p>
<p class="person">
Martha.
</p>
<p>
Never seen such a fog, eh?
</p>
<p class="direction">
<i>
Comes nearer and speaks mysteriously.
</i>
</p>
<p>
Did you happen to notice how long that fog has been hangin' over this house?
</p>
<p class="person">
Beeler.
</p>
<p>
How long? Why, since Thursday.
</p>
<p class="person">
Martha.
</p>
<p>
No, sir, since Wednesday night.
</p>
<p class="person">
Beeler.
</p>
<p class="direction">
<i>
Looking at her, astonished.
</i>
</p>
<p>
Martha Beeler! You don't mean to say&#8212;he
<i>
brought
</i>
the fog?
</p>
<p class="direction">
<i>
She flounces out without answering. He lights lantern, with dubious head-shaking, and holds it up before the print portraits.
</i>
</p>
<p>
Mornin', Mr. Darwin. Same to you, Mr. Spencer. Still keepin' things straight?
</p>
<p class="direction">
<i>
Grunts as he turns down his lantern, which is smoking.
</i>
</p>
<p>
I guess not very.
</p>
<p class="direction">
<i>
The hall door again opens, and Rhoda Williams, a girl of twenty, enters, with Annie Beeler, a child of ten. Rhoda is running, with Annie in laughing pursuit.
</i>
</p>
<p class="person">
Rhoda.
</p>
<p class="direction">
<i>
Taking refuge behind the table.
</i>
</p>
<p>
King's X!
</p>
<p class="person">
Annie.
</p>
<p class="direction">
<i>
Catching her.
</i>
</p>
<p>
You didn't have your fingers crossed.
</p>
<p class="person">
Rhoda.
</p>
<p class="direction">
<i>
Turning Annie about, and beginning to button the child's long slip.
</i>
</p>
<p>
And you didn't have your dress buttoned.
</p>
<p class="person">
Annie.
</p>
<p>
That doesn't count.
</p>
<p class="person">
Rhoda.
</p>
<p>
Yes, it does, before breakfast!
</p>
<p class="person">
Beeler.
</p>
<p class="direction">
<i>
At the outer door.
</i>
</p>
<p>
How does your aunt strike you this morning?
</p>
<p class="person">
Rhoda.
</p>
<p class="direction">
<i>
Sobered.
</i>
</p>
<p>
She seems wonderfully better.
</p>
<p class="person">
Beeler.
</p>
<p>
Better!
</p>
<p class="person">
Rhoda.
</p>
<p>
I don't mean her poor body. She's got past caring for that.
</p>
<p class="person">
Beeler.
</p>
<p class="direction">
<i>
With sarcasm.
</i>
</p>
<p>
You mean in her mind, eh?
</p>
<p class="person">
Rhoda.
</p>
<p>
Yes, I mean better in her mind.
</p>
<p class="person">
Beeler.
</p>
<p>
Because of what this fellow has been sayin' to her, I suppose.
</p>
<p class="person">
Rhoda.
</p>
<p>
Yes, because of that.
</p>
<p class="person">
Beeler.
</p>
<p class="direction">
<i>
As he puts on an old fur cap.
</i>
</p>
<p>
An out-and-out fakir!
</p>
<p class="person">
Rhoda.
</p>
<p>
You don't know him.
</p>
<p class="person">
Beeler.
</p>
<p>
I suppose you do, after forty-eight hours. What in the name of nonsense is he, anyway? And this deaf and dumb Indian boy he drags around with him. What's his part in the show?
</p>
<p class="person">
Rhoda.
</p>
<p>
I know very little about either of them. But I know Mr. Michaelis is not&#8212;what you say.
</p>
<p class="person">
Beeler.
</p>
<p>
Well, he's a crank at the best of it. He's worked your aunt up now so's she can't sleep. You brought him here, and you've got to get rid of him.
</p>
<p class="direction">
<i>
Exit by outer door, with inarticulate grumblings, among which can be distinguished.
</i>
</p>
<p>
Hump! Ulrich Michaelis! There's a name for you.
</p>
<p class="person">
Annie.
</p>
<p>
What's a fakir?
</p>
<p class="direction">
<i>
Rhoda does not answer.
</i>
</p>
<p>
Cousin Rho, what's a fakir?
</p>
<p class="person">
Rhoda.
</p>
<p class="direction">
<i>
Humoring her.
</i>
</p>
<p>
A man, way off on the other side of the world, in India, who does strange things.
</p>
<p class="person">
Annie.
</p>
<p>
What kind of things?
</p>
<p class="person">
Rhoda.
</p>
<p>
Well, for instance, he throws a rope up in the air, right up in the empty air, with nothing for it to catch on, and then&#8212;he&#8212;climbs&#8212;up&#8212;the&#8212;rope!
</p>
<p class="person">
Annie.
</p>
<p>
Don't he fall?
</p>
<p class="direction">
<i>
Rhoda shakes her head in portentous negation.
</i>
</p>
<p class="direction">
<i>
Steps are heard descending the stairs. The child fidgets nervously.
</i>
</p>
<p class="person">
Annie.
</p>
<p>
Listen! He's coming down!
</p>
<p class="person">
Rhoda.
</p>
<p>
Yes, he's coming down, right out of the blue sky.
</p>
<p class="person">
Annie.
</p>
<p class="direction">
<i>
In a panic.
</i>
</p>
<p>
Let me go.
</p>
<p class="direction">
<i>
She breaks away and retreats to the hall door, watching the stair door open, and Ulrich Michaelis enter. Thereupon, with a glance of frightened curiosity, she flees. Michaelis is a man of twenty-eight or thirty, and his dark, emaciated face, wrinkled by sun and wind, looks older. His abundant hair is worn longer than common. His frame, though slight, is powerful, and his way of handling himself has the freedom and largeness which come from much open-air life. There is nevertheless something nervous and restless in his movements. He has a trick of handling things, putting them down only to take them up again immediately, before renouncing them for good. His face shows the effect of sleeplessness, and his gray flannel shirt and dark, coarse clothing are rumpled and neglected.
</i>
</p>
<p class="person">
Rhoda.
</p>
<p class="direction">
<i>
As he enters.
</i>
</p>
<p>
Good morning.
</p>
<p class="person">
Michaelis.
</p>
<p class="direction">
<i>
Watching Annie's retreat.
</i>
</p>
<p>
Is&#8212;is that child afraid of me?
</p>
<p class="person">
Rhoda.
</p>
<p class="direction">
<i>
As she adds the finishing touches to the breakfast table.
</i>
</p>
<p>
Oh, Annie's a queer little body. She has her mother's nerves. And then she sees no one, living here on the back road. If this dreadful fog ever lifts, you'll see that, though we're quite near town, it's almost as if we were in the wilderness.
</p>
<p class="direction">
<i>
The stair door opens, and an Indian boy, about sixteen years old, enters. He is dressed in ordinary clothes; his dark skin, longish hair, and the noiseless tread of his moccasined feet, are the only suggestions of his race. He bows to Rhoda, who returns his salutation; then, with a glance at Michaelis, he goes out doors.
</i>
</p>
<p class="direction">
<i>
Rhoda nods toward the closing door.
</i>
</p>
<p>
It's really him Annie's afraid of. He's like a creature from another world, to her.
</p>
<p class="person">
Michaelis.
</p>
<p class="direction">
<i>
Looks at her in an odd, startled way.
</i>
</p>
<p>
Another world?
</p>
<p class="person">
Rhoda.
</p>
<p>
Oh, you're used to his people. Your father was a missionary to the Indians, you told me.
</p>
<p class="person">
Michaelis.
</p>
<p>
Yes.
</p>
<p class="person">
Rhoda.
</p>
<p>
Where?
</p>
<p class="person">
Michaelis.
</p>
<p>
At Acoma.
</p>
<p class="person">
Rhoda.
</p>
<p>
Where is that?
</p>
<p class="person">
Michaelis.
</p>
<p class="direction">
<i>
Standing near the wall map, touches it.
</i>
</p>
<p>
In New Mexico, by the map.
</p>
<p class="person">
Rhoda.
</p>
<p class="direction">
<i>
Comes nearer.
</i>
</p>
<p>
What is it like?
</p>
<p class="person">
Michaelis.
</p>
<p>
It's&#8212;as you say&#8212;another world.
</p>
<p class="person">
Rhoda.
</p>
<p>
Describe it to me.
</p>
<p class="person">
Michaelis.
</p>
<p>
I couldn't make you see it. It's&#8212;centuries and centuries from our time.&#8212;And since I came here, since I entered this house, it has seemed centuries away from my own life.
</p>
<p class="person">
Rhoda.
</p>
<p>
My life has seemed far off, too&#8212;my old life&#8212;
</p>
<p class="person">
Michaelis.
</p>
<p>
What do you mean by your old life?
</p>
<p class="person">
Rhoda.
</p>
<p class="direction">
<i>
She breaks out impulsively.
</i>
</p>
<p>
I mean&#8212;I mean&#8212;. Three days ago I was like one dead! I walked and ate and did my daily tasks, but&#8212;I wondered sometimes why people didn't see that I was dead, and scream at me.
</p>
<p class="person">
Michaelis.
</p>
<p>
It was three days ago that I first saw you.
</p>
<p class="person">
Rhoda.
</p>
<p>
Yes.
</p>
<p class="person">
Michaelis.
</p>
<p>
Three nights ago, out there in the moonlit country.
</p>
<p class="person">
Rhoda.
</p>
<p>
Yes.
</p>
<p class="person">
Michaelis.
</p>
<p>
You were unhappy, then?
</p>
<p class="person">
Rhoda.
</p>
<p>
The dead are not unhappy, and I was as one dead.
</p>
<p class="person">
Michaelis.
</p>
<p>
Why was that?
</p>
<p class="person">
Rhoda.
</p>
<p>
I think we die more than once when things are too hard and too bitter.
</p>
<p class="person">
Michaelis.
</p>
<p>
Have things here been hard and bitter?
</p>
<p class="person">
Rhoda.
</p>
<p>
No. All that was before I came here! But it had left me feeling&#8212;. The other night, as I walked through the streets of the town, the people seemed like ghosts to me, and I myself like a ghost.
</p>
<p class="person">
Michaelis.
</p>
<p>
I cannot think of you as anything but glad and free.
</p>
<p class="person">
Rhoda.
</p>
<p>
When you met me on the road, and walked home with me, and said those few words, it was as if, all of a sudden, the dead dream was shattered, and I began once more to live.
</p>
<p class="direction">
<i>
Bell rings.
</i>
</p>
<p>
That is Aunt Mary's bell.
</p>
<p class="direction">
<i>
Rhoda goes out by the hall door, wheeling the invalid chair. Martha enters from the kitchen, carrying a steaming coffee-pot and a platter of smoking meat, which she places on the table. Michaelis bows to her.
</i>
</p>
<p class="person">
Martha.
</p>
<p class="direction">
<i>
Snappishly.
</i>
</p>
<p>
Hope you slept well!
</p>
<p class="direction">
<i>
She goes to the outer door, rings the breakfast bell loudly, and exit to kitchen. Rhoda enters, wheeling Mrs. Beeler in an invalid chair. Mrs. Beeler is a woman of forty, slight of body, with hair just beginning to silver. Her face has the curious refinement which physical suffering sometimes brings. Annie lingers at the door, looking timidly at Michaelis, as he approaches Mrs. Beeler and takes her hand from the arm of the chair.
</i>
</p>
<p class="person">
Michaelis.
</p>
<p>
You are better?
</p>
<p class="person">
Mrs. Beeler.
</p>
<p class="direction">
<i>
Speaks with low intensity.
</i>
</p>
<p>
Much, much better.
</p>
<p class="direction">
<i>
He puts her hand gently back on the chair arm. Martha enters with other dishes. She pours out coffee, putting a cup at each plate. Mr. Beeler has entered from the kitchen, and the boy from outside. Beeler, with a glance of annoyance at his wife and Michaelis, sits down at the head of the table. Rhoda pushes Mrs. Beeler's chair to the foot of the table and stands feeding her, eating her own breakfast meanwhile.
</i>
</p>
<p class="direction">
<i>
Michaelis sits at Mrs. Beeler's right, Martha opposite. At Mr. Beeler's right is the Indian boy, at his left Annie's vacant chair. Martha beckons to Annie to come to the table, but the child, eyeing the strangers, refuses, taking a chair behind her mother by the mantelpiece. Mrs. Beeler speaks after the meal has progressed for some time in silence.
</i>
</p>
<p class="person">
Mrs. Beeler.
</p>
<p>
Mat, you haven't said good morning to our guest.
</p>
<p class="person">
Beeler.
</p>
<p class="direction">
<i>
Gruffly.
</i>
</p>
<p>

He helps himself to meat and passes it to the others; the plate goes round the table. There is a constrained silence. Annie tugs at Rhoda's skirt, and asks in dumb show to have her breakfast given her. Rhoda fills the child's plate, with which she retreats to her place by the mantel.

Michaelis, holding Annie's hand, rises, goes to the window, and rolls up the shades, while Rhoda extinguishes the lamp. The fog is still thick, and the light which enters is dull.

Rhoda wheels the chair toward the hall door, which Michaelis opens. Mrs. Beeler gazes at him as she passes.

She has tried medicine, doctors?

Rhoda.

Bethesda? Where is that?

Michaelis.
</p>
<p>
The pool, which is called Bethesda, having five porches.
</p>
<p class="person">
Rhoda.

<p>
Oh, yes. The pool in the Bible, where once a year an angel troubled the waters, and the sick and the lame and the blind gathered, hoping to be healed.
</p>
<p class="person">
Michaelis.
</p>
<p>
And whoever first, after the troubling of the waters, stepped in, he was made whole of whatsoever disease he had.

If anybody could find the way there again, it would be Aunt Mary.

Perhaps in this way it is clearer still.

Leans nearer.

</p>
<p>
All my life long I have walked in the light of something to come, some labor, some mission, I have scarcely known what&#8212;but I have risen with it and lain down with it, and nothing else has existed for me.&#8212;Nothing, until&#8212;I lifted my eyes and you stood there. The stars looked down from their places, the earth wheeled on among the stars. Everything was as it had been, and nothing was as it had been; nor ever, ever can it be the same again.

A great table of stone, rising five hundred feet out of the endless waste of sand. A little adobe house, halfway up the mesa, with the desert far below and the Indian village far above. A few peach trees, and a spring&#8212;a sacred spring, which the Indians worshipped in secret. A little chapel, which my father had built with his own hands. He often spent the night there, praying. And there, one night, he died. I found him in the morning, lying as if in quiet prayer before the altar.

Michaelis.
</p>
<p>
I went away south, into the mountains, and got work on a sheep range. I was a shepherd for five years.

<p>
And since then?

Since then I have&#8212;wandered about, working here and there to earn enough to live on.

Rhoda.

<p>
I understand well why men take up that life. I should love it myself.

Rhoda.

To fulfil my life&#8212;my real life.

Your&#8212;real life?

There in the mountains, when you were a shepherd&#8212;that was not your real life?

It was the beginning of it.

<p>
Won't you tell me a little about that time?

In the fall I would drive the sheep south, through the great basin which sloped down into Mexico, and in the spring back again to the mountains.
</p>
<p class="person">
Rhoda.
</p>
<p>
Were you all alone?

There were a few men on the ranges, but they were no more to me than the sheep&#8212;not so much.

Rhoda.

<p>
Weren't you dreadfully lonely?

<p class="person">
Michaelis.

No.

His excitement increases.

It was one morning in the fourth spring. We were back in the mountains again. It was lambing time, and I had been up all night. Just before sunrise, I sat down on a rock to rest. Then&#8212;it came.

No.&#8212;But twice&#8212;I heard a voice.

<p>
What kind of a voice?
</p>
<p class="person">
Michaelis.

<p>
The first time it came at night. I was walking on the top of the mountain, in a stony place. It&#8212;it was like a wind among the stones.

And the second time?
</p>
<p class="person">
Michaelis.

In the same place, at dawn. The voice said, &#34;Go forth, it is finished!&#34; I looked round me and saw nothing. Then it came again, like a wind among the stones, &#34;Go forth, it is begun!&#34;

Rhoda.

<p>
I found a man to take my place, and started north. Three days after, I climbed the mesa toward my old home. Above, in the pueblo, I heard the sound of tom-toms and wailing squaws. They told me that the young son of the chief lay dead in my father's chapel. I sat beside him all day and all night. Just before daylight&#8212;

<p>
Just before daylight, when the other watchers were asleep, the power of the spirit came strong upon me. I bowed myself upon the boy's body, and prayed. My heart burned within me, for I felt his heart begin to beat! His eyes opened. I told him to arise, and he arose. He that was dead arose and was alive again!

With bent head he goes out. Rhoda stands looking after him until the inner door closes, then sits before the fire in revery. Beeler comes in from the barn. He wears his old fur cap, and holds in one hand a bulky Sunday newspaper, in the other some battered harness, an awl, twine, and wax, which he deposits on the window seat. He lays the paper on the table, and unfolds from it a large colored print, which he holds up and looks at with relish.

There he sits playin' Jenny-come-kiss-me on his dod-gasted mouth-organ, when along comes one of them fellows out of a monastery, with religion on the brain. Pikin' for Jerusalem, to get a saint's toe-nail and a splinter of the true cross.

Martha enters from the kitchen and potters about the room &#34;redding up.&#34;

Look at him! Do you think he'll ever get to Jerusalem? Not this trip! He hears the pipes o' Pan. He hears women callin' and fiddles squeakin' love-tunes in the woods. It'll take more than a monk's robe on his back and a shaved head on his shoulders to keep him straight, I reckon. He'll call to mind that young fellows had blood in their veins when Adam was a farmer, and whoop-la! he'll be off to the county fair, to dance ring-around-a-rosy with Matildy Jane!

Mr. and Mrs. Beeler move toward the entrance door; some of the others start after, some linger, curious to know what will happen to the child. Michaelis turns upon them with a commanding gesture.

Go, all of you!

The room is cleared except for Littlefield, who goes last, stops in the doorway, closes the door, and approaches Michaelis. He speaks in a friendly and reasonable tone.

Littlefield.

I heard you. I want to say a word or two first. For your own sake and for that woman's sake, you'd better listen. You can't do anything for her baby.

Michaelis.
</p>
<p>
Is that for you to say?
</p>
<p class="person">
Littlefield.

<p>
Yes, sir! It is most decidedly for me to say.
</p>
<p class="person">
Michaelis.
</p>
<p>
By what authority?
</p>
<p class="person">
Littlefield.
</p>
<p>
By the authority of medical knowledge.&#8212;You are a very remarkable man, with a very remarkable gift. In your own field, I take off my hat to you. If you knew yourself as science knows you, you might make the greatest doctor living. Your handling of Mrs. Beeler's case was masterly. But&#8212;come right down to it&#8212;<i>you

didn't work the cure.

No, sir! He whom

They're in no mood for failures, out there.

Michaelis's gaze, as if in spite of himself, goes to the window. He rests his hand on the table, to stop its trembling. Littlefield goes on, watching him with interest.
</i>
</p>
<p>
Nervously speaking, you are a high power machine. The dynamo that runs you is what is called &#34;faith,&#34; &#34;religious inspiration,&#34; or whatnot. It's a dynamo which nowadays easily gets out of order. Well, my friend, as a doctor, I warn you that your little dynamo is out of order.&#8212;In other words, you've lost your grip. You're in a funk.

Don't have to go to professional medicine for cases. They're lying around loose. Why, when I was at Ann Arbor&#8212;in a fraternity initiation&#8212;we bared a chap's shoulders, showed him a white-hot poker, blindfolded him, told him to stand steady, and&#8212;touched him with a piece of ice.

You cannot hang the whole issue and meaning of your life upon so slight a thread.
</p>
<p class="person">
Michaelis.
</p>
<p>
The whole issue and meaning of the world hang on threads as slight. If this one is slight. To the mother it is not slight, nor to the God who put into her eyes, as she looked at me, all the doubt and question of the suffering earth.
</p>
<p class="person">
Rhoda.

You must remember that it is only a little child. Its mind is not open. You cannot influence it&#8212;can you?
</p>
<p class="person">
Michaelis.
</p>
<p>
Once that little life in my hand would have been as clay in the hands of the potter. If I cannot help now, it is because my ministry has been taken from me and given to another, who will be strong where I am weak, and faithful where I am unfaithful.

Michaelis.

<p>
All my life long I have known you, and fled from you, I have heard you singing on the hills of sleep and have fled from you into the waking day. I have seen you in the spring forest, dancing and throwing your webs of sunlight to snare me; on moonlit mountains, laughing and calling; in the streets of crowded cities, beckoning and disappearing in the crowd&#8212;and everywhere I have fled from you, holding above my head the sign of God's power in me, my gift and my mission.&#8212;What use? What use? It has crumbled, and I do not care!
</p>

Rhoda.

Oh, don't speak such words, I beseech you. Let me go. This must not, shall not be!

I know a place out there, high in the great mountains. Heaven-piercing walls of stone, a valley of trees and sweet water in the midst&#8212;grass and flowers, such flowers as you have never dreamed could grow.&#8212;There we will take our happiness. A year&#8212;a month&#8212;a day&#8212;what matter? We will make a lifetime of each hour!

The deep hush of their embrace is broken by a cry from within. The young mother opens the hall door, in a distraction of terror and grief.

She disappears. Rhoda follows, drawing Michaelis, dazed and half resisting, with her. The room remains vacant for a short time, the stage held by distant singing. Beeler enters from the kitchen. There is a knock at the outer door, which he opens. Littlefield, Culpepper, and Uncle Abe enter.

She breaks off, as a murmur of voices rises outside. There is a sound of stumbling and crowding on the outer steps, and violent knocking. The outer door is forced open, and a crowd of excited people is about to pour into the room. Beeler, the Doctor, and the Preacher are able to force the crowd back only after several have made an entrance.

Michaelis appears in the hall door. There is a low murmur of excitement, expectation, and awe among the people crowded in the entrance. Beeler crosses to help his wife, and the other men step to one side, leaving Michaelis to confront the crowd alone. Confused, half-whispered exclamations:

His enemies are scattered! Year after year I have heard His voice calling me&#8212;and year after year I have said, &#34;Show me the way.&#34; And He showed me the way. He brought me to this house, and He raised up the believing multitude around me. But in that hour I failed Him, I failed Him. He has smitten me, as His enemies are smitten.&#8212;As a whirlwind He has scattered me and taken my strength from me forever.

He advances into the room, with a gesture backward through the open door.

In yonder room a child lies dead on its mother's knees, and the mother's eyes follow me with curses.

At the news of the child's death, Mrs. Beeler has sunk with a low moan into a chair, where she lies white and motionless. Michaelis turns to her.

<p class="chapter">
ACT III
</p>
<p class="intro">
<i>
The next morning, just before sunrise. Both door and windows are open, and a light breeze sways the curtains. Outside is a tree-shaded and vine-clad porch, with balustrade, beyond which is a tangle of flowering bushes and fruit trees in bloom. The effect is of a rich warm dawn&#8212;a sudden onset of summer weather after a bleak spring.
</i>
</p>
<p class="intro">
<i>
Beeler, with Uncle Abe looking on, is busy putting up the pictures which he has taken down in the preceding act. Martha enters from the hall.

Yes. Wants to go out on the porch and watch the sun rise, same as she's done every Easter morning since Seth died.

Beeler.

<p>
Won't hurt her, I reckon, bad off as she is.&#8212;A reg'lar old-fashioned, sunshiny, blossomy spring mornin'&#8212;summer here with a jump and fine growin' weather.

Yes, ma'am. That's just why. Religion!

You women don't want things explained, any more'n Abe here! You prefer hocus-pocus. And nothin' will teach you. Take Rhody! Sees Michaelis flunk his job miserable. Sees Mary go down like a woman shot, hands and legs paralyzed again,&#8212;Doctor says, for good, this time. And what does the girl do about it? Spends the night out yonder laborin' with them benighted sick folks, tellin' 'em the healer will make good. Lots of makin' good he'll do!

You're dead wrong. I tell you he never looked cross-eyed at Rhody, nor Rhody at him. Doctor's more in her line.&#8212;By the way, did you give the Doctor a snack to stay his stomach?

You do not know that, even yet. You know it now less than ever&#8212;what your life is, what it means to you, what it means to the world.
</p>
<p class="person">
Michaelis.
</p>
<p>
To the world it can mean nothing. That is ended. But to us it can mean happiness. Let us make haste to gather it. Come!
</p>
<p class="person">
Rhoda.
</p>
<p>
Where do you want me to go?
</p>
<p class="person">
Michaelis.
</p>
<p>
Anywhere&#8212;to that place I told you of&#8212;high in the great mountains.
</p>
<p class="person">
Rhoda.
</p>
<p>
I was there last night.
</p>
<p class="person">
Michaelis.
</p>
<p>
In your thoughts?
</p>
<p class="person">
Rhoda.
</p>
<p>
I was there, and saw all the beauty of it, all the peace. But one thing was not there, and for lack of it, in a little while the beauty faded and the peace was gone.
</p>
<p class="person">
Michaelis.
</p>
<p>
What was not there?
</p>
<p class="person">
Rhoda.
</p>
<p>
The work you have to do.
</p>
<p class="person">
Michaelis.
</p>
<p>
That was a dream I could not realize. I have striven, and I have failed.
</p>
<p class="person">
Rhoda.
</p>
<p>
Do you know why you have failed?
</p>
<p class="person">
Michaelis.
</p>
<p>
Yes.
</p>
<p class="person">
Rhoda.
</p>
<p>
Tell me why.
</p>
<p class="person">
Michaelis.
</p>
<p>
Because I have loved you more than the visions that came to me in desert places, more than the powers that fell upon me at the bedside of the sick, more than the spirit hands and spirit voices that have guided me on my way.
</p>
<p class="person">
Rhoda.
</p>
<p>
What of the sick and suffering out yonder, who are waiting and hoping against hope? What of them?
</p>
<p class="person">
Michaelis.
</p>
<p>
I cannot help them.
</p>
<p class="person">
Rhoda.
</p>
<p>
Once you dreamed you could.
</p>
<p class="person">
Michaelis.
</p>
<p>
Yes. But that is over.
</p>
<p class="person">
Rhoda.
</p>
<p>
And who is to blame that that great dream is over?
</p>
<p class="person">
Michaelis.
</p>
<p>
No one is to blame. It has happened so.
</p>
<p class="person">
Rhoda.
</p>
<p>
Doesn't it seem strange that the love of a woman entering into your heart should take away such a dream as that?
</p>
<p class="person">
Michaelis.
</p>
<p>
I do not question. It is so.
</p>
<p class="person">
Rhoda.
</p>
<p>
But if your love had fallen, by some sad chance, upon a woman who was not worthy of love?
</p>
<p class="person">
Michaelis.
</p>
<p>
What are you saying?
</p>
<p class="person">
Rhoda.
</p>
<p>
You know less than nothing of me. You have not asked me a single question about my life.
</p>
<p class="person">
Michaelis.
</p>
<p>
There was no need.
</p>
<p class="person">
Rhoda.
</p>
<p>
There was need! There was need!
</p>
<p class="person">
Michaelis.
</p>
<p>
Be careful what you say. Go on!
</p>
<p class="person">
Rhoda.
</p>
<p>
In the first hour of our meeting, and all the hours of the next day, you swept me along and lifted me above myself, like a strong mind. I didn't know what you were. I didn't know why I was happy and exalted. It was so long since I had been happy, and I had never been as happy as that, or anything like it. Then, yesterday morning, came the revelation of what you were, like a blinding light out of the sky! And while I stood dazed, trembling, I saw something descend upon you like a shadow. You loved me, and that love was dreadful to you. You thought it was so because I was a woman and stole your spirit's strength away. But it was not that. It was because I was a
<i>
wicked
</i>
woman.
</p>
<p class="person">
Michaelis.
</p>
<p>
Why do you call yourself a wicked woman?
</p>
<p class="person">
Rhoda.
</p>
<p>
Because I am so.
</p>
<p class="person">
Michaelis.
</p>
<p>
I cannot believe it.
</p>
<p class="person">
Rhoda.
</p>
<p>
It is true.
</p>
<p class="person">
Michaelis.
</p>
<p>
Is that why you wanted to go away?
</p>
<p class="person">
Rhoda.
</p>
<p>
Yes, I tried to go away. You wouldn't let me go. Then I tried to tell you the truth. I knew why I took your strength away, and I had nerved myself to tell you why. But you began to speak&#8212;those wild words. I could not resist you. You took me in your arms; and all the power of your soul went from you, and your life went crashing down in darkness.
</p>
<p class="direction">
<i>
Long pause.
</i>
</p>
<p class="person">
Michaelis.
</p>
<p>
Wicked? A wicked woman?
</p>
<p class="person">
Rhoda.
</p>
<p>
I was young then, wild-hearted, pitifully ignorant. I thought that love had come to me. Girls are so eager for love. They snatch at the shadow of it.&#8212;That is what I did.&#8212;I am not trying to plead for myself.&#8212;Some things are not to be forgiven.&#8212;Somewhere in my nature there was a taint&#8212;a plague-spot.&#8212;If life is given me, I shall find it and root it out. I only ask for time to do that. But meanwhile I have done what I could. I have told you the truth. I have set you free. I have given you back your mission.

I should have chosen a more secluded nook to say this in, but you're skittish, as I have learned to my cost, and likely to bolt. What I want to say is,

What I am is no matter. What this girl is, though you lived a thousand years, you would never have the grace to imagine. She gave you her young love, in childish blindness, not knowing what she did, and you killed it idly, wantonly, as a beast tortures its frail victim, for sport. You find her again, still weak and bleeding from her wounds, and you fling her marriage, in words whose every syllable is an insult. Marriage! When every fibre of her nature must cry out against you, if she is woman. Take your words and your looks from her, and that instantly, or you will curse the day you ever brought your evil presence into her life.

Mrs. Beeler, there is such a perfume about us this beautiful Easter morning. You perceive it, with senses which suffering and a pure soul have made fine beyond the measure of woman. There is a kindness in the air, new-born happiness, and new-risen hope.

In that blind hour my life sank in ruin.&#8212;I had thought love denied to such as had my work to do, and in the darkness of that thought disaster overwhelmed me.&#8212;I have come to know that God does not deny love to any of his children, but gives it as a beautiful and simple gift to them all.&#8212;Upon each head be the use that is made of it!

A little while ago you told me your life's bitter story. I tasted your struggle, went down with you into the depths of your anguish, and in those depths,&#8212;the miracle! Behold, once more the stars looked down upon me from their places, and I stood wondering as a child wonders. Out of those depths arose new-born happiness and new-risen hope. For in those star-lit depths of pain and grief, I had found at last true love. You needed me. You needed all the powers I had thrown away for your sake. You needed what the whole world needs&#8212;healing, healing, and as I rose to meet that need, the power that I had lost poured back into my soul.

I looked into your eyes once, and they were terrible as an army with banners. I look again now, and I see they are only a girl's eyes, very weak, very pitiful. I told you of a place, high in the great mountains. I tell you now of another place higher yet, in more mysterious mountains. Let us go there together, step by step, from faith to faith, and from strength to strength, for I see depths of life open and heights of love come out, which I never dreamed of till now!

&#34;This play stands as a noteworthy achievement in the history of American dramatic literature, not alone as a drama of absorbing interest and significance, but as a distinct achievement from a literary point of view. It is a pleasure to read the crisp, admirable English, a prose at once vigorous, clear, and balanced. In the cold black and white of print and paper, without the accessories of the stage or the personality of actors to help illusion or enforce the story told, the real strength of the drama is most impressive. Mr. Moody has long been known as a poet of unusual gifts; he has now proven himself a dramatist of marked ability.&#34;&#8212;<i>Brooklyn Daily Eagle.

&#34;It is a privilege to read at leisure and to examine in detail a play which, when presented upon the boards, sweeps the auditor along in a whirlwind of emotion.... The triumph of nature, with its impulse, its health, its essential sanity and rightness, over the cryptic formulas of convention and Puritanism, marks the meaning of the play.... Yet because it is a great drama, it may mean that to one and quite another thing to another, but meaning this, or meaning that, it must make, inevitably, an indelible impression upon any one interested in the vitality and evolution of the American drama.&#34;&#8212;<i>Chicago Tribune.

<hr class="short">
<p class="blurb">
&#34;This play is in a class by itself because it has high literary merit aside from great dramatic force. The poet flashes out frequently in the terse lines of the early part of the play, and later reaches high-water mark in the scenes at Stephen Ghent's home on the mountain top. The play is worth many readings.&#34;&#8212;<i>San Francisco Chronicle.
